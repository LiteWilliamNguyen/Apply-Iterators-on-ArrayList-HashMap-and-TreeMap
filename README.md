Java Iterators with ArrayList, HashMap, and TreeMap

Below is a comprehensive README.md file for your project:

Java Iterators with ArrayList, HashMap, and TreeMap
This project demonstrates the use of iterators in Java to traverse and 
manipulate collections such as ArrayList, HashMap, and TreeMap. It includes 
functionality for iteration, modification, and testing of these collections, 
as well as detailed test cases implemented using JUnit 5.

Features

ArrayList Operations:

Iteration using an Iterator.
Removal of elements using the Iterator's remove() method.
Handling modifications during iteration.
HashMap Operations:

Iteration over entrySet() using an Iterator.
Safe removal of entries during iteration.
Modification of values in the map during iteration.
TreeMap Operations:

Iteration over entrySet() using an Iterator.
Analysis of data (e.g., finding highest and lowest values).
Handling the natural ordering of TreeMap keys.
Unit Testing:

Comprehensive test coverage with JUnit 5, including:
Normal cases.
Edge cases (e.g., empty collections, concurrent modification).
